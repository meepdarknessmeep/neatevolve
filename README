Please download the release to use this in an environment.

The original idea was shown to me on SethBling's youtube channel.

What this does:
1.  Uses LuaJit and ffi (included in the releases)
2.  Increases speed
3.  Increases accuracy (internal neurons are pixel based and hitbox based)


What needs to be done:
1.  Allow restart / reloading of script. Currently freezes indefinitely
2.  Fix slanted blocks having full 16x16 block in neuron map


To use effectively, enable Hide Banner and use the rest of the default settings.
